# ðŸ““ Tolga's Learning Journal

Hi there!  
I'm Tolga, currently enrolled in the Workintech Fullstack UpPro program.  
In this repository, Iâ€™m documenting what I learn, the projects I build, and the challenges I faceâ€”week by week.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started â€“ June 12, 2025
### ðŸ§  Topic: JavaScript Variables & Data Types

**What I learned:**
- Declaring variables with `let` and `const`
- Understanding data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- Logging outputs using `console.log()`

**Challenges:**
- The difference between `null` and `undefined` â€” I need to revisit this

**Mini project idea:**
A simple program that asks for a birth year and calculates the userâ€™s age.

**Next goal:**
Learn about functions and try building a number guessing game.
